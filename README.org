* Introspection
** dir built-in function
  - dir: abbrev 'directory' (list of things, not necessarily files)
  - [[http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#dir][dir in docs]]
  - returns list of *attributes* of given object
  - dir is intended for shell use, so it doesn't return all attributes
    (for example metaclass attrs are missing)
  - you can override what dir returns for given object by supplying
    __dir__ method for it. Note that your class must inherit object to
    do that
  - funny thing is that print is a statement (not a function) in
    Python2.x, hence you can't say dir(print)
** vars, __dict__
  - instance variables of object obj are stored in its __dict__
    dictionary. You can fetch it using function vars(obj)
** using dot operator
   - when you use dot operator on an instance of a class A to get a
     method foo Python first checks for foo in the instance (in its
     __dict__)
  - it won't find it as there are only instance variables
  - then it looks for foo in the type of the instances - A.
  - foo is in A.__dict__, so Python knows which method to call
